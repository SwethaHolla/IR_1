# Information Retrieval ‚Äì Exercise 1

This notebook is was done as a part of Information Retrieval module for the MSc Data Science program at the University of Glasgow. It explores the basics of IR systems including preprocessing, Boolean retrieval, and vector space models.

### üß† Key Topics

- Tokenisation and preprocessing  
- Boolean retrieval model  
- Vector Space Model (VSM)  
- Term Frequency (TF), Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)  
- Document-query similarity scoring  

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- `nltk`, `numpy`, `pandas`  
- Custom functions for IR scoring and search  

### üéØ Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure and purpose of basic IR models  
- Build document-term matrices and compute relevance  
- Implement and test query matching using Boolean and vector approaches
